## 1. DESIGN THINKING & CREATIVE PROCESS

### 1.1 Design Thinking Framework (PRESERVED FROM FRONTEND-DESIGN)

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

**Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:**

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

**Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:**
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

### 1.2 Extended Design Process

**Phase 1: Discovery & Research**
1. **Understand Users:**
   - Who are they? (demographics, psychographics)
   - What are their goals and pain points?
   - What's their context of use? (device, environment, expertise)
   - What are their mental models?

2. **Competitive Analysis:**
   - What solutions exist already?
   - What works well? What fails?
   - What gaps can we fill?
   - How can we differentiate?

3. **Define Success Metrics:**
   - User task completion rate
   - Time on task
   - Error rate
   - User satisfaction (NPS, SUS score)
   - Business KPIs (conversion, retention, engagement)

**Phase 2: Ideation & Concept**
1. **Sketching & Wireframing:**
   - Low-fidelity exploration (paper, whiteboard, Figma)
   - Multiple concepts (divergent thinking)
   - Focus on structure and flow, not aesthetics

2. **Information Architecture:**
   - Content hierarchy
   - Navigation structure
   - User flows and journeys
   - Edge cases and error states

3. **Design Direction:**
   - Mood boards (visual inspiration)
   - Style tiles (typography, color, imagery)
   - Motion studies (animation concepts)
   - Choose 1-2 directions to refine

**Phase 3: Design & Refinement**
1. **High-Fidelity Design:**
   - Apply aesthetic direction
   - Create component variations
   - Design all states (default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading)
   - Design responsive breakpoints

2. **Prototyping:**
   - Interactive prototypes (Figma, Framer)
   - Micro-interactions and animations
   - User flow walkthroughs
   - Test with stakeholders

3. **Design Review:**
   - Present to stakeholders
   - Gather feedback
   - Iterate based on insights
   - Validate with users (if possible)

**Phase 4: Implementation**
1. **Component Development:**
   - Build design system components
   - Implement responsive behavior
   - Add animations and interactions
   - Ensure accessibility

2. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Device testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Accessibility audit
   - Performance testing

3. **Handoff to Principal Engineer:**
   - Submit design for architecture review
   - Explain design decisions and constraints
   - Address feedback and iterate
   - Get approval before implementation proceeds

## 2. FRONTEND AESTHETICS GUIDELINES

### 2.1 Core Aesthetic Principles (PRESERVED FROM FRONTEND-DESIGN)

**Focus on:**

**Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

**Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

**Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.

**Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.

**Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

**NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like:**
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

**Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.**

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

**Remember: You are capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.**

### 2.2 Typography Deep Dive

**Type Hierarchy:**
```
Display (H1): 48-96px - Hero headlines, landing pages
Heading 1 (H2): 32-48px - Page titles
Heading 2 (H3): 24-32px - Section headers
Heading 3 (H4): 20-24px - Subsection headers
Body Large: 18-20px - Intro paragraphs, emphasis
Body: 16-18px - Main content (optimal for reading)
Body Small: 14-16px - Secondary info, captions
Caption: 12-14px - Metadata, footnotes
```

**Font Pairing Strategy:**
1. **Contrast Pairing:** Serif + Sans-serif (classic, balanced)
   - Example: Playfair Display + Inter, Merriweather + Open Sans

2. **Concordant Pairing:** Same family, different weights
   - Example: Roboto Thin + Roboto Bold

3. **Conflict Pairing:** Two distinctive fonts (requires skill)
   - Example: Cooper Black + Futura

**Font Psychology:**
- **Serif:** Traditional, trustworthy, authoritative (finance, law, editorial)
- **Sans-serif:** Modern, clean, approachable (tech, startups, SaaS)
- **Script:** Elegant, creative, personal (luxury, weddings, creative)
- **Monospace:** Technical, precise, developer-focused (coding, data)
- **Display:** Distinctive, attention-grabbing (branding, headlines)

**Typographic Best Practices:**
- Line length: 50-75 characters for optimal readability
- Line height: 1.5-1.75 for body text, 1.2-1.4 for headings
- Letter spacing: Tighter for headings (-0.02em), normal for body
- Font weight: Minimum 400 for body, 600-700 for emphasis
- Avoid ALL CAPS for long text (reduces readability by 10%)
- Use proper quotes (" ") not straight quotes (" ")
- Em dashes (—) not hyphens (-) for breaks

**Variable Fonts:**
- Single file, multiple weights/styles
- Smooth weight transitions
- Performance benefits
- Examples: Inter Variable, Recursive, Source Sans Variable

### 2.3 Color Theory & Application

**Color Psychology:**
- **Red:** Energy, passion, urgency, danger (CTAs, errors, sales)
- **Blue:** Trust, calm, professionalism (finance, healthcare, social)
- **Green:** Growth, health, success, nature (sustainability, finance, health)
- **Yellow:** Optimism, warmth, caution (food, children, warnings)
- **Purple:** Luxury, creativity, spirituality (beauty, premium brands)
- **Orange:** Friendly, enthusiastic, affordable (retail, food, kids)
- **Black:** Sophistication, power, luxury (fashion, automotive, tech)
- **White:** Clean, simple, honest (minimal, healthcare, tech)

**Color Harmony Systems:**

**Monochromatic:** Single hue, different shades/tints
- Cohesive, elegant, safe
- Example: Navy → Sky Blue → Powder Blue

**Analogous:** Adjacent colors on wheel (30° apart)
- Harmonious, natural, low contrast
- Example: Blue → Blue-Green → Green

**Complementary:** Opposite colors on wheel (180° apart)
- High contrast, vibrant, attention-grabbing
- Example: Blue ↔ Orange, Red ↔ Green

**Triadic:** Three colors evenly spaced (120° apart)
- Balanced, vibrant, diverse
- Example: Red → Yellow → Blue

**Split-Complementary:** Base + two adjacent to complement
- High contrast, less tension than complementary
- Example: Blue + Red-Orange + Yellow-Orange

**Tetradic (Double-Complementary):** Two complementary pairs
- Rich, complex, hard to balance
- Example: Blue + Orange + Red + Green

**Color Palette Structure:**
```
Primary (60%): Main brand color, dominant in UI
Secondary (30%): Supporting color, accents
Accent (10%): Call-to-action, highlights, emphasis

+ Neutrals:
- Background: #FFFFFF, #F8F9FA (light) or #1A1A1A, #0F0F0F (dark)
- Text: #1A1A1A (light mode), #F8F9FA (dark mode)
- Borders: rgba(0,0,0,0.1) (light), rgba(255,255,255,0.1) (dark)

+ Semantic:
- Success: Green (#10B981, #22C55E)
- Warning: Yellow/Orange (#F59E0B, #EF4444)
- Error: Red (#EF4444, #DC2626)
- Info: Blue (#3B82F6, #2563EB)
```

**Accessibility Color Standards:**
- **WCAG AA:** 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18px+)
- **WCAG AAA:** 7:1 for normal text, 4.5:1 for large text
- Use tools: Contrast Checker, ColorSafe, Stark

**Color Systems:**
- **CSS Variables:** Define once, use everywhere
```css
:root {
  --primary-50: #EFF6FF;
  --primary-500: #3B82F6;
  --primary-900: #1E3A8A;
}
```
- **Tailwind:** Pre-defined scales (50-950)
- **Material Design:** 500 as base, lighter/darker variants

### 2.4 Motion & Animation Principles

**Disney's 12 Principles of Animation (Applied to UI):**

1. **Squash and Stretch:** Exaggerate deformation for impact
   - Button press: slightly squash on click
   - Modal entrance: scale from 0.9 to 1.0

2. **Anticipation:** Prepare user for action
   - Button: slight lift before click animation
   - Drawer: small pullback before opening

3. **Staging:** Direct attention to what's important
   - Fade background when modal appears
   - Highlight active step in multi-step form

4. **Straight Ahead vs. Pose to Pose:**
   - Straight: Continuous animation (loading spinners)
   - Pose: Keyframe animation (page transitions)

5. **Follow Through:** Elements don't stop abruptly
   - Menu: items continue moving slightly after stop
   - Scroll: momentum continues, then decelerates

6. **Slow In/Slow Out:** Ease, not linear
   - Use cubic-bezier for natural movement
   - `ease-out` for entrances, `ease-in` for exits

7. **Arc:** Natural movement follows curves, not straight lines
   - Dropdown: arc from top to position
   - Tooltips: curved trajectory

8. **Secondary Action:** Supporting animations
   - Button click: ripple effect + color change
   - Notification: slide in + icon bounce

9. **Timing:** Speed = emotion
   - Fast (100-200ms): Micro-interactions, feedback
   - Medium (200-400ms): Transitions, state changes
   - Slow (400-600ms): Page loads, reveals
   - Never > 1000ms unless loading

10. **Exaggeration:** Amplify for emphasis
    - Success checkmark: overshoot then bounce back
    - Error shake: exaggerated left-right movement

11. **Solid Drawing:** 3D thinking in 2D space
    - Use transforms (translateZ) for depth
    - Layer elements for parallax

12. **Appeal:** Make it delightful
    - Add personality through animation
    - Surprise with unexpected motion

**Easing Functions:**
```css
/* Material Design Curves */
--standard: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1); /* Default */
--decelerate: cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1); /* Entrance */
--accelerate: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1); /* Exit */
--sharp: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 1); /* Interruption */

/* iOS Curves */
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1);

/* Custom (bounce, elastic, etc.) */
--bounce: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55);
```

**Animation Performance:**
- Animate ONLY: `transform` and `opacity` (GPU-accelerated)
- AVOID animating: `width`, `height`, `top`, `left` (triggers reflow)
- Use `will-change` sparingly (memory intensive)
- Prefer CSS animations over JavaScript (better performance)
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for JS animations

**Motion Accessibility:**
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

## 3. UI/UX DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS

### 3.1 Core UX Principles

**1. User-Centered Design:**
- Design for users, not yourself
- Validate assumptions through research
- Involve users throughout the process
- Iterate based on feedback

**2. Usability Heuristics (Nielsen's 10):**

**a) Visibility of System Status:**
- Always inform users about what's happening
- Loading indicators, progress bars
- Success/error messages
- Active state indicators

**b) Match Between System and Real World:**
- Use familiar language and concepts
- Follow real-world conventions
- Metaphors users understand

**c) User Control and Freedom:**
- Undo/redo functionality
- Cancel buttons for all actions
- Easy navigation, no dead ends
- Breadcrumbs and back buttons

**d) Consistency and Standards:**
- Follow platform conventions
- Internal consistency (same action = same result)
- Industry standards (hamburger menu, search icon)

**e) Error Prevention:**
- Prevent errors before they occur
- Constraints and validation
- Confirmations for destructive actions
- Clear defaults and suggestions

**f) Recognition Rather Than Recall:**
- Make options visible
- Auto-complete and suggestions
- Recently used items
- Visual cues over memory

**g) Flexibility and Efficiency:**
- Shortcuts for power users (keyboard shortcuts)
- Customization options
- Bulk actions
- Multiple ways to complete tasks

**h) Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:**
- Every element should have a purpose
- Remove unnecessary information
- Visual hierarchy
- "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away" - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

**i) Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors:**
- Plain language error messages (not error codes)
- Explain what went wrong
- Suggest how to fix it
- Make it easy to recover

**j) Help and Documentation:**
- Ideally, no documentation needed
- If needed: searchable, task-focused, concise
- Contextual help (tooltips, inline hints)
- Video tutorials for complex tasks

### 3.2 Gestalt Principles

**1. Proximity:**
- Elements close together are perceived as related
- Use whitespace to group/separate
- Example: Form fields grouped by category

**2. Similarity:**
- Similar elements are perceived as belonging together
- Same color, shape, size, font
- Example: All buttons same style, all links same color

**3. Continuity:**
- Eye follows paths and lines
- Create visual flow with alignment
- Example: Reading order follows F-pattern

**4. Closure:**
- Mind completes incomplete shapes
- Can use partial elements to save space
- Example: Hamburger menu icon

**5. Figure/Ground:**
- Distinguish object from background
- Sufficient contrast
- Example: Modal overlay darkens background

**6. Common Fate:**
- Elements moving together are perceived as related
- Animate related elements together
- Example: Cards animating in as a group

**7. Symmetry:**
- Symmetric elements perceived as whole
- Creates balance and harmony
- Example: Centered layouts, mirrored navigation

### 3.3 Fitts's Law

**Principle:** Time to acquire target = f(Distance, Size)

**Implications:**
- Make important buttons large and close to cursor
- Edges and corners are "infinite" size (easy to hit)
- Group related actions close together
- Mobile: Minimum touch target 44x44px (iOS), 48x48px (Android)
- Desktop: Minimum click target 24x24px

**Applications:**
- Primary CTA: Larger than secondary buttons
- Dropdown menus: Target includes entire item, not just text
- Navigation: Important links easier to reach

### 3.4 Hick's Law

**Principle:** Decision time increases logarithmically with choices

**Implications:**
- Limit options (7±2 rule, though 5 is better)
- Categorize choices into smaller groups
- Progressive disclosure (show advanced options later)
- Sane defaults to reduce decision burden

**Applications:**
- Navigation: < 7 main menu items
- Forms: Use dropdowns/radio for < 7 options, search/autocomplete for > 7
- Onboarding: Focus on core features first

### 3.5 Miller's Law

**Principle:** Average person can hold 7±2 items in working memory

**Implications:**
- Chunk information into groups
- Use progressive disclosure
- Don't overwhelm with options

**Applications:**
- Phone numbers: (123) 456-7890 (chunked)
- Navigation: Group items into categories
- Forms: Multi-step for > 7 fields

### 3.6 Jakob's Law

**Principle:** Users prefer your site to work like others they know

**Implications:**
- Follow established patterns
- Logo in top-left links to homepage
- Search in top-right
- Hamburger menu for mobile nav
- Shopping cart icon for e-commerce

**Don't Reinvent (Unless You Have Good Reason):**
- Standard iconography (trash = delete, pencil = edit)
- Form patterns (email, password, etc.)
- Navigation structures

3. Recruit participants (5-8 users per round)
4. Prepare prototype or product

**Execution:**
1. Welcome and consent
2. Background questions
3. Task scenarios (think-aloud protocol)
4. Post-task questions (SUS, satisfaction ratings)
5. Debrief

**Analysis:**
1. Note observations (issues, pain points, delights)
2. Severity rating (critical, high, medium, low)
3. Prioritize fixes (impact vs. effort)
4. Iterate and test again

**Metrics:**

**Task Success Rate:**
- % of users who complete task successfully
- Target: > 80%

**Time on Task:**
- How long to complete task
- Compare to benchmarks

**Error Rate:**
- Number of errors per task
- Target: < 3 errors

## 6. VISUAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### 6.1 Visual Hierarchy

**Purpose:** Guide user attention to most important elements first

**Techniques:**

**1. Size:**
- Larger = more important
- Headlines > Subheads > Body

**2. Color:**
- High contrast = attention
- Bright colors for CTAs
- Muted for secondary elements

**3. Contrast:**
- Light vs. dark
- Thick vs. thin
- Texture vs. smooth

**4. Alignment:**
- Aligned elements = organized
- Break alignment for emphasis

**5. Proximity:**
- Related elements close together
- Whitespace separates groups

**6. Repetition:**
- Consistent style = unified
- Same treatment for similar elements

**7. Position:**
- Top-left = first attention (F-pattern)
- Center = focal point
- Bottom-right = last (Z-pattern)

**8. Motion:**
- Animated elements draw attention
- Use sparingly for emphasis

### 6.2 Grid Systems

**Types:**

**1. Column Grid:**
- 12-column most common (divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6)
- Gutter: 20-30px
- Margin: 15-20px mobile, 60-80px desktop

**2. Modular Grid:**
- Rows + columns
- Consistent spacing units
- 8px or 4px base unit

**3. Baseline Grid:**
- Vertical rhythm
- Text aligns to horizontal lines
- Line height consistent

**4. Responsive Grid:**
- Fluid (%) vs. Fixed (px)
- Breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 320-480px
  - Tablet: 768-1024px
  - Desktop: 1280px+
  - Large: 1920px+

**Bootstrap Grid:**

}
```

### 6.3 Spacing System

**8-Point Grid:**
- All spacing multiples of 8px (4px for tight spaces)
- Consistent rhythm
- Easier math
- Aligns with common screen sizes (divisible by 8)

**Scale:**

- Consistent style (all photos vs. mix)

**Icons:**

**Styles:**
- **Line:** Modern, minimal, scalable (Feather, Heroicons)
- **Filled:** Bold, high contrast (Material, Font Awesome)
- **Duotone:** Two colors, depth (Phosphor)

**Guidelines:**
- Consistent stroke weight (1.5-2px typical)
- Same style throughout (don't mix line + filled)
- Optical alignment (visual balance, not mathematical)
- 24x24px minimum touch target
- Pair with labels for clarity (icon alone = ambiguous)

**Icon Sets:**
- Heroicons, Feather, Lucide, Phosphor, Ionicons
- Material Icons, Font Awesome, Remix Icon

## 7. INTERACTION DESIGN

### 7.1 Micro-interactions

**Structure (Dan Saffer):**

**1. Trigger:**
- User-initiated (click, swipe, type)
- System-initiated (notification, timer, sensor)

**2. Rules:**
- What happens when triggered
- Logic and constraints

**3. Feedback:**
- Visual, audio, haptic
- Confirms action

**4. Loops & Modes:**
- Repetition behavior
- State changes

**Examples:**

**Like Button:**
- Trigger: Click
- Rules: Toggle state, update count
- Feedback: Heart fills with color, slight bounce
- Modes: Liked (filled) vs. Unliked (outline)

**Pull to Refresh:**
- Trigger: Pull down on list
- Rules: Load new content when threshold reached
- Feedback: Spinner appears, list animates
- Loops: Check for updates every 30s

**Form Validation:**
- Trigger: Input blur or submit
- Rules: Check against validation schema
- Feedback: Error message, red border
- Modes: Valid (green check), Invalid (red X), Neutral

### 7.2 States & Feedback

**Interactive Element States:**

**1. Default (Rest):**
- Initial state
- Example: Button with primary color

**2. Hover:**
- Mouse over element
- Subtle change (lighten, shadow, scale)
- Example: Background lightens 5%

**3. Active (Pressed):**
- Click or touch down
- More dramatic change
- Example: Button scales to 0.98, darkens

**4. Focus:**
- Keyboard navigation
- Clear outline (accessibility)
- Example: 2px blue outline

**5. Disabled:**
- Not interactive
- Visual: 40% opacity, no hover
- Example: Grayed out, cursor: not-allowed

**6. Loading:**
- Action in progress
- Spinner, skeleton, progress bar
- Disable interaction while loading

**7. Success:**
- Action completed
- Green checkmark, success message
- Example: "Saved" feedback

**8. Error:**
- Action failed
- Red color, error icon, message
- Example: "Email invalid"

**Feedback Timing:**
- Immediate (< 100ms): Feels instant
- Brief (100-200ms): Responsive
- Moderate (200-400ms): Intentional
- Long (400-600ms): Consider progress indicator
- Very long (> 1s): MUST show progress

### 7.3 Transitions & Page Loads

**Page Transitions:**

**1. Fade:**
- Simple, universal
- Fade out old, fade in new
- Duration: 200-300ms

**2. Slide:**
- Directional (left/right for navigation)
- Mobile: slide from right for deeper level
- Duration: 300-400ms

**3. Scale:**
- Zoom in/out
- Modal dialogs
- Duration: 200-300ms

**4. Shared Element:**
- Element morphs between pages
- Creates continuity
- Example: Product image expands to detail page

**Loading States:**

**1. Skeleton Screens:**
- Gray placeholder shapes
- Reduces perceived wait time
- Example: Facebook, LinkedIn

**2. Spinners:**
- Indeterminate progress
- Use when duration unknown
- Center on screen or section

**3. Progress Bars:**
- Determinate (0-100%)
- Show progress when calculable
- Example: File upload, multi-step form

**4. Optimistic UI:**
- Assume success, update immediately
- Rollback if fails
- Example: Like button (update UI, then API call)

---

## 8. ACCESSIBILITY & INCLUSIVE DESIGN

### 8.1 WCAG 2.1 Guidelines

**Levels:**
- **A:** Minimum (legal requirement in many countries)
- **AA:** Target for most sites (industry standard)
- **AAA:** Enhanced (gold standard)

**Four Principles (POUR):**

**1. Perceivable:**
- Information presentable to users in ways they can perceive

**a) Text Alternatives:**
- Alt text for images
- Captions for videos
- Transcripts for audio

**b) Adaptable:**
- Content can be presented different ways
- Responsive design
- Semantic HTML

**c) Distinguishable:**
- Easy to see and hear
- Color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- Resizable text (200% without loss)
- No content loss at 320px viewport

**2. Operable:**
- Interface components navigable and operable

**a) Keyboard Accessible:**
- All functionality via keyboard
- No keyboard traps
- Skip to main content link

**b) Enough Time:**
- Disable time limits or allow extension
- Pause, stop, hide moving content

**c) Seizures:**
- No flashing > 3 times per second
- No large flashing areas

**d) Navigable:**
- Clear headings and labels
- Logical tab order
- Focus indicators visible
- Multiple ways to find pages (nav, search, sitemap)

**3. Understandable:**
- Information and operation must be understandable

**a) Readable:**
- Language identified (<html lang="en">)
- Unusual words defined
- Reading level appropriate

**b) Predictable:**
- Consistent navigation
- Consistent identification (icons, labels)
- No changes on focus

**c) Input Assistance:**
- Error identification
- Labels or instructions
- Error suggestions
- Error prevention (confirmations)

**4. Robust:**
- Content interpretable by wide variety of user agents

**a) Compatible:**
- Valid HTML
- Name, role, value for all UI components
- Status messages (ARIA live regions)

### 8.2 Screen Readers & Semantic HTML

**Semantic Elements:**
```html
<header> - Site header
<nav> - Navigation
<main> - Main content (one per page)
<article> - Self-contained content
<section> - Thematic grouping
<aside> - Sidebar, related content
<footer> - Site footer

<h1> to <h6> - Headings (hierarchical)
<p> - Paragraphs
<ul>, <ol>, <li> - Lists
<a> - Links (descriptive text, not "click here")
<button> - Buttons (not <div> with onclick)
<form>, <input>, <label> - Forms
```

**ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications):**

**Roles:**
```html
<div role="button"> - When semantic HTML not possible
<div role="alert"> - Important message
<div role="dialog"> - Modal dialog
<div role="navigation"> - Navigation landmark
```

**Properties:**
```html
<button aria-label="Close dialog"> - Label when text not visible
<input aria-describedby="error-msg"> - Additional description
<div aria-hidden="true"> - Hide from screen readers (decorative)
```

**States:**
```html
<button aria-expanded="false"> - Collapsed state
<button aria-pressed="true"> - Toggle button state
<div aria-busy="true"> - Loading state
```

**Live Regions:**
```html
<div aria-live="polite"> - Announce when convenient
<div aria-live="assertive"> - Announce immediately
<div role="status"> - Status message
<div role="alert"> - Error message
```

**Best Practices:**
- Prefer semantic HTML over ARIA
- Don't use ARIA if HTML element exists
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

### 8.3 Keyboard Navigation

**Requirements:**
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Logical tab order
- Visible focus indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts documented

**Tab Order:**
- Natural reading order (top to bottom, left to right)
- Use `tabindex="0"` to add to tab order
- Use `tabindex="-1"` to remove (programmatic focus only)
- Avoid `tabindex > 0` (disrupts natural order)

**Focus Indicators:**
```css
/* Custom focus style */
:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #3B82F6;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* Don't remove outline without replacement */
:focus {
  outline: none; /* ❌ NEVER DO THIS */
}
```

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- **Tab:** Next interactive element
- **Shift + Tab:** Previous element
- **Enter:** Activate button, submit form
- **Space:** Activate button, toggle checkbox
- **Escape:** Close dialog, cancel action
- **Arrow keys:** Navigate within component (select, tabs, menu)
- **Home/End:** First/last item in list

**Skip Links:**
```html
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">
  Skip to main content
</a>

<main id="main-content">
  <!-- Content -->
</main>
```

### 8.4 Inclusive Design Considerations

**Motor Disabilities:**
- Large click/touch targets (44x44px minimum)
- No hover-only interactions
- Avoid time-based interactions
- Support voice control

**Visual Disabilities:**
- High contrast mode support
- Scalable text (rem, em, not px)
- No information by color alone
- Support screen magnifiers

**Cognitive Disabilities:**
- Simple language (8th-grade reading level)
- Clear instructions
- Consistent navigation
- Avoid overwhelming content
- Allow more time

**Hearing Disabilities:**
- Captions for videos
- Transcripts for audio
- Visual indicators for sounds (chat notification)

**Temporary Disabilities:**
- Bright sunlight (low contrast)
- Broken arm (one-handed use)
- Loud environment (can't hear audio)

**Situational Disabilities:**
- Holding baby (one hand)
- Distracted (driving - voice control)
- Low bandwidth (slow loading)

- Grid system
- Iconography
- Elevation (shadows, z-index)
- Border radius
- Animation curves

**Components:**
- Buttons (primary, secondary, tertiary, ghost)
- Form inputs (text, select, checkbox, radio, switch)
- Navigation (header, sidebar, tabs, breadcrumbs)
- Cards
- Modals & dialogs
- Tooltips & popovers

### 9.2 Component Design Principles

**Atomic Design (Brad Frost):**

**Atoms:**
- Basic building blocks
- Button, input, label, icon
- Not useful alone

**Molecules:**
- Groups of atoms
- Search form (input + button)
- Form field (label + input + error)

**Organisms:**
- Complex components
- Header (logo + nav + search + user menu)
- Product card (image + title + price + button)

**Templates:**
- Page layouts
- Wireframe-level
- Shows structure

**Pages:**
- Specific instances of templates
- With real content

**Component API Design:**
```typescript
// Good: Clear, flexible, typed
<Button 
  variant="primary" | "secondary" | "ghost"
  size="sm" | "md" | "lg"
  disabled={boolean}
  loading={boolean}
  onClick={() => void}
  icon={ReactNode}
  fullWidth={boolean}
>
  Button Text
</Button>

// Bad: Unclear, limited, untyped
<Button type="1" big={true} click={fn}>Text</Button>
```

### 9.3 Design Tokens

**Definition:** Named variables for design decisions

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "color": {
    "primary": {
      "50": "#EFF6FF",
      "500": "#3B82F6",
      "900": "#1E3A8A"
    }
  },
  "spacing": {
    "xs": "4px",
    "sm": "8px",
    "md": "16px",
    "lg": "24px",
    "xl": "32px"
  },
  "typography": {
    "fontFamily": {
      "sans": "Inter, system-ui, sans-serif",
      "mono": "Fira Code, monospace"
    },
    "fontSize": {
      "xs": "12px",
      "sm": "14px",
      "base": "16px",
      "lg": "18px",
      "xl": "20px"
    }
  }
}
```

**Tools:**
- Style Dictionary (Amazon)
- Theo (Salesforce)
- Design Tokens (W3C Community Group)

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth
- Platform-agnostic (export to CSS, iOS, Android)
- Theming (light/dark mode)
- Consistency across products

## 10. RESPONSIVE & ADAPTIVE DESIGN

### 10.1 Mobile-First Approach

**Philosophy:**
- Design for smallest screen first
- Progressively enhance for larger screens
- Forces prioritization of content

**CSS Approach:**
```css
/* Mobile default (320px+) */
.container {
  padding: 16px;
}

/* Tablet (768px+) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 24px;
  }
}

/* Desktop (1280px+) */
@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  .container {
    padding: 32px;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}
```

### 10.2 Breakpoint Strategy

**Common Breakpoints:**
```
Mobile:     320px - 767px   (portrait phones)
Tablet:     768px - 1023px  (tablets, landscape phones)
Desktop:    1024px - 1279px (laptops, small desktops)
Large:      1280px - 1919px (desktops)
XL:         1920px+         (large monitors)
```

**Tailwind Breakpoints:**
```
sm:  640px
md:  768px
lg:  1024px
xl:  1280px
2xl: 1536px
```

**Content-Based Breakpoints:**
- Don't design for devices, design for content
- Add breakpoint when layout breaks
- Test with browser resize, not just device sizes

### 10.3 Responsive Patterns

**1. Column Drop:**
- Multi-column on desktop
- Stack columns on mobile
- Most common pattern

**2. Mostly Fluid:**
- Multi-column with margins
- Margins adjust, content width stays proportional
- Common for content-heavy sites

**3. Layout Shifter:**
- Different layouts at different breakpoints
- Most flexibility, most complexity

**4. Off Canvas:**
- Navigation hidden off-screen on mobile
- Hamburger menu reveals
- Preserves screen real estate

**5. Tiny Tweaks:**
- Minor adjustments only
- Font size, padding, margins
- Simple single-column layouts

### 10.4 Touch vs. Mouse Interactions

**Touch Considerations:**
- No hover state (use active/pressed instead)
- Larger targets (44x44px minimum)
- Swipe gestures (carousel, drawer)
- Long-press (context menu alternative)
- Double-tap (zoom)
- Pinch (zoom in/out)
- Pull to refresh

**Mouse Considerations:**
- Hover states for feedback
- Cursor changes (pointer, grab, text)
- Right-click context menus
- Tooltips on hover
- Drag and drop

**Cross-Device:**
- Support both touch and mouse
- Progressive enhancement
- Test on actual devices

## 12. PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION

### 12.1 Web Performance Metrics

**Core Web Vitals:**

**1. LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):**
- Time to render largest content element
- **Good:** < 2.5s
- **Needs Improvement:** 2.5-4s
- **Poor:** > 4s

**Optimization:**
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Preload critical resources
- Reduce server response time
- Minimize render-blocking resources

**2. FID (First Input Delay):**
- Time from user interaction to browser response
- **Good:** < 100ms
- **Needs Improvement:** 100-300ms
- **Poor:** > 300ms

**Optimization:**
- Minimize JavaScript execution time
- Break up long tasks (code splitting)
- Use web workers for heavy computation
- Defer non-critical JavaScript

**3. CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):**
- Visual stability (unexpected layout shifts)
- **Good:** < 0.1
- **Needs Improvement:** 0.1-0.25
- **Poor:** > 0.25

**Optimization:**
- Set image/video dimensions
- Avoid inserting content above existing
- Reserve space for ads
- Use `font-display: swap` carefully

**Other Metrics:**

**TTFB (Time to First Byte):**
- Server response time
- **Good:** < 200ms

**FCP (First Contentful Paint):**
- Time to first render
- **Good:** < 1.8s

**TTI (Time to Interactive):**
- Time until fully interactive
- **Good:** < 3.8s

### 12.2 Image Optimization

**Formats:**
- **WebP:** 25-35% smaller than JPEG, wide support
- **AVIF:** 50% smaller than JPEG, growing support
- **JPEG:** Photos, gradients
- **PNG:** Transparency, simple graphics
- **SVG:** Icons, logos, illustrations (scalable)

**Techniques:**

**1. Responsive Images:**
```html
<img 
  srcset="
    image-320w.webp 320w,
    image-640w.webp 640w,
    image-1280w.webp 1280w
  "
  sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1280px) 50vw, 33vw"
  src="image-640w.webp"
  alt="Description"
  width="640"
  height="480"
/>
```

**2. Lazy Loading:**
```html
<img src="image.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Description" />
```

**3. Next-Gen Formats with Fallback:**
```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />
</picture>
```

**4. CDN & Optimization Services:**
- Cloudflare Images
- Cloudinary
- imgix
- Next.js Image Component (automatic optimization)

### 12.3 Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

**Route-Based Code Splitting:**
```typescript
// React
const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import('./Dashboard'));

<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <Dashboard />
</Suspense>

// Next.js (automatic)
// pages/dashboard.tsx → automatically code-split
```

**Component-Based Code Splitting:**
```typescript
// Only load when needed
const HeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));

// Conditional loading
{showHeavy && (
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <HeavyComponent />
  </Suspense>
)}
```

**Dynamic Imports:**
```typescript
// Load library only when needed
async function handleClick() {
  const { default: Chart } = await import('chart.js');
  // Use Chart
}
```

### 12.4 Bundle Optimization

**Tree Shaking:**
- Remove unused code
- Use ES modules (import/export)
- Avoid `import *`
```typescript
// Good (tree-shakeable)
import { Button } from 'library';

// Bad (imports entire library)
import * as Library from 'library';
```

**Minification:**
- Terser (JavaScript)
- cssnano (CSS)
- Automatically done by bundlers (Webpack, Vite, etc.)

**Compression:**
- Gzip (universal, 70% reduction)
- Brotli (better, 80% reduction, modern browsers)
- Configure on server (Nginx, CDN)

**Bundle Analysis:**
- Webpack Bundle Analyzer
- Next.js built-in analyzer
- Source Map Explorer
- Identify large dependencies, optimize or replace
