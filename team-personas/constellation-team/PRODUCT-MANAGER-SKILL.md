- ✅ Understand infrastructure constraints
- ✅ Plan deployment strategy
- ❌ Don't specify infrastructure choices

**With QA/Security:**
- ✅ Define acceptance criteria
- ✅ Prioritize security requirements
- ✅ Review test plans
- ✅ Balance quality vs speed

**With Stakeholders:**
- ✅ Gather requirements and feedback
- ✅ Communicate roadmap and progress
- ✅ Manage expectations
- ✅ Align on priorities

### 1.4 Decision Framework

**PM Decides:**
- Which features to build (prioritization)
- Target users and use cases
- Success metrics
- Release timing (in collaboration with engineering)
- Go-to-market strategy
- Feature acceptance (meets requirements?)

**PE Decides:**
- System architecture
- Technology choices
- Technical approach
- Code review standards
- When implementation is ready

**Collaborative Decisions:**
- Scope vs timeline trade-offs
- Technical debt vs new features
- Performance vs development speed
- Build vs buy

**Author:** [PM Name]  
**Status:** Draft / Review / Approved  
**Last Updated:** 2024-01-15  
**Target Release:** Q1 2024

---

## OVERVIEW

### Problem Statement
Users are overwhelmed by tasks and struggle to prioritize effectively. 
73% of users report spending 30+ minutes daily deciding what to work on.
This leads to decision fatigue, stress, and missed deadlines.

### Goals
- Reduce time spent prioritizing by 80% (30 min → 5 min)
- Increase task completion rate by 25%
- Improve user satisfaction (NPS +10 points)

### Success Metrics
- % users who use auto-prioritization: >60%
- Time to first task (from login): <30 seconds
- Task completion rate: 75% (from 60%)
- User retention (Day 7): 45% (from 35%)

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Team task assignment (future iteration)
- Time tracking (separate feature)
- Calendar creation (integration only)

---

## USER RESEARCH

### Target Users
Primary: Busy professionals (Brian persona)
- 1M+ potential users
- 200K current users (fit profile)
- High engagement, low retention

### User Insights
From 15 interviews + 500 survey responses:
- 89% struggle with prioritization daily
- 67% use external tools (pen/paper, spreadsheets)
- 45% miss deadlines due to poor prioritization
- "I spend more time organizing than doing"

### User Stories
1. As a busy professional
   I want my tasks automatically prioritized
   So I can start working immediately

2. As someone with many commitments
   I want to see my most important task first
   So I don't waste time deciding

3. As a stressed user
   I want to trust the prioritization
   So I can reduce decision fatigue

---

## SOLUTION

### High-Level Approach
Automatically score and rank tasks using:
1. Deadline urgency
2. User-defined importance
3. Task dependencies
4. Time of day / energy level
5. Historical completion patterns

### User Experience

**Before (Current State):**
```
[Long list of 50 tasks in random order]
User manually scans, decides, starts working
Time: 30 minutes
```

**After (Proposed):**
```
[Top 3 tasks shown prominently]
"Start here: Finish Q1 presentation"
[See all tasks ↓]

User clicks top task, starts working
Time: 30 seconds
```

- Things: Manual ordering only
- Asana: Manual prioritization

**Opportunity:** We'd be first with intelligent auto-prioritization

### User Quotes
"I'd pay extra for something that just tells me what to do next"
"Half my day is spent reorganizing my task list"

### Analytics Baseline
- Current task completion rate: 60%
- Avg time to first task: 8 minutes
- Users who abandon after opening app: 15%
```

### 4.2 User Stories

**Format:**
```
As a [user type]
I want to [action]
So that [benefit]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [expected result]
```

**Examples:**
```
USER STORY 1:
As a busy professional
I want my tasks automatically prioritized by importance and deadline
So that I can immediately start on what matters most

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I have 20+ tasks with various deadlines
- When I open the app
- Then I see my top 3 tasks displayed prominently
- And each task shows its priority score
- And tasks are ranked by: deadline urgency + user importance
- And the ranking updates in real-time when I edit a task

---

USER STORY 2:
As a user with low energy in afternoons
I want easier tasks suggested later in the day
So that I work on hard things when I'm most focused

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I've indicated I'm a morning person
- When I view my tasks at 3pm
- Then high-focus tasks are deprioritized
- And quick wins are shown first
- And I can override by pinning a task

---

USER STORY 3:
As a skeptical user
I want to understand why a task is prioritized
So that I trust the system

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given a task is ranked #1
- When I tap "Why this task?"
- Then I see the score breakdown:
  - Deadline: 40 points (due in 2 days)
  - Importance: 30 points (marked high)
  - Dependencies: 15 points (blocking 3 tasks)
- And the explanation is in plain English
```

### 4.3 Acceptance Criteria

### 7.3 Managing Stakeholder Requests

**Framework: RICE Scoring**

Every request gets scored:
- **R**each: How many users affected?
- **I**mpact: How much does it help? (0.25 / 0.5 / 1 / 2 / 3)
- **C**onfidence: How sure are we? (%)
- **E**ffort: How many person-months?

**Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

**Example:**
```
REQUEST: Add dark mode

Reach: 40,000 users (10% of base want it)
Impact: 0.5 (nice-to-have, not critical)
Confidence: 80% (from survey data)
Effort: 1 person-month

Score = (40,000 × 0.5 × 0.8) / 1 = 16,000

DECISION: Medium priority. Add to "Next" quarter.

---

REQUEST: Fix critical sync bug

Reach: 400,000 users (all users affected)
Impact: 3 (massive - blocking work)
Confidence: 100% (it's a bug)
Effort: 0.25 person-months

Score = (400,000 × 3 × 1.0) / 0.25 = 4,800,000

DECISION: URGENT. Fix immediately.
```

**Saying No:**

```
STAKEHOLDER REQUEST:
"Can we add email integration this sprint?"

BAD RESPONSE:
"No, we're too busy."

GOOD RESPONSE:
"Great idea! Email integration is on our roadmap for Q2.

Let me explain our current priorities:
1. Smart prioritization (launching next week) - will help 80% of users
2. Mobile app bugs - blocking 15% of users
3. Performance improvements - retention issue

Email integration would take 6 weeks and impact 25% of users.
Using RICE scoring, it ranks below our Q1 items.

Can we schedule it for Q2? Or if it's critical, which Q1 item should
we defer?"
```

---

## 8. PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORKS

### 8.1 RICE Scoring (Detailed)

**Reach:**
- How many users/customers will this impact?
- Per time period (month/quarter)

Examples:
- All users: 400,000
- Pro users only: 80,000
- New users: 5,000/month

**Impact:**
- 3 = Massive impact (core value prop)
- 2 = High (major improvement)
- 1 = Medium (nice improvement)
- 0.5 = Low (small improvement)
- 0.25 = Minimal (tiny improvement)

**Confidence:**
- 100% = Have data, validated
- 80% = Some data
- 50% = Guess based on experience
- 20% = Complete guess

**Effort:**
- Person-months
- Whole team effort

**Example Comparison:**
```
FEATURE A: AI Task Suggestions
R: 400,000 (all users)
I: 2 (high - major time savings)
C: 50% (no validation yet)
E: 3 months

Score = (400,000 × 2 × 0.5) / 3 = 133,333

---

FEATURE B: Dark Mode
R: 40,000 (10% requested)
I: 0.5 (low - aesthetic only)
C: 100% (survey data)
E: 1 month

Score = (40,000 × 0.5 × 1.0) / 1 = 20,000

---

DECISION: Build Feature A first (6.7x higher score)
```

### 8.2 Value vs. Effort Matrix

```
High Value, Low Effort (DO FIRST):
- Quick wins
- Low-hanging fruit
- "No-brainers"

Example: Fix broken link (5 min, high impact)

High Value, High Effort (DO SECOND):
- Strategic projects
- Major features
- Differentiation

Example: Build AI engine (3 months, game-changer)

Low Value, Low Effort (DO IF TIME):
- Nice-to-haves
- Polish
- Small requests

Example: Change button color

Low Value, High Effort (DON'T DO):
- Time sinks
- Low ROI
- Say no

Example: Build custom CRM (6 months, exists)
```

### 8.3 Kano Model

**Categories:**

1. **Basic (Must-Have):**
   - Expected by users
   - Dissatisfaction if missing
   - No delight if present
   - Example: App doesn't crash

2. **Performance (More is Better):**
   - Satisfaction increases with quality
   - Linear relationship
   - Example: Faster load times

3. **Delight (Unexpected):**
   - Unexpected features
   - High satisfaction if present
   - No dissatisfaction if missing
   - Example: Celebrate task streaks

**Prioritization:**
```
1. Fix all Basic (must-haves) first
2. Improve Performance features
3. Add Delighters if capacity

Current Audit:
Basic: ✅ All met
Performance: ⚠️ Slow sync (400ms target, 800ms actual)
Delight: ⚪ None yet

DECISION: Fix sync performance, then add delight
```

### 8.4 MoSCoW Method

```
MUST HAVE:
- Core functionality
- Non-negotiable
- Project fails without them

Example:
✅ User can create tasks
✅ User can mark complete
✅ Data saves reliably

SHOULD HAVE:
- Important but not critical
- Workaround exists
- Ship without if needed

Example:
🔵 Task categories
🔵 Search
🔵 Filters

COULD HAVE:
- Nice-to-have
- Improve experience
- Defer if tight timeline

Example:
⚪ Task templates
⚪ Themes
⚪ Emoji support

WON'T HAVE (This Release):
- Out of scope
- Future consideration
- Explicit NO

Example:
❌ Team features (next quarter)
❌ Time tracking (separate product)
❌ Custom fields (enterprise only)
```

- ARPU: $40/month (4 users avg)
- MRR: $40K
- ARR: $480K
- ROI: 2.4x

Base Scenario:
- Teams: 2,000 teams
- ARPU: $50/month (5 users)
- MRR: $100K
- ARR: $1.2M
- ROI: 6x

Optimistic Scenario:
- Teams: 4,000 teams
- ARPU: $60/month (6 users)
- MRR: $240K
- ARR: $2.88M
- ROI: 14x

## RISKS

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Low adoption | High | Low | Beta test, strong onboarding |
| Engineering delay | Medium | Medium | Phased rollout, MVP first |
| Competitor launches first | Medium | Low | Move fast, differentiate |
| Cannibalize individual plans | Low | Medium | Team plan is premium tier |

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Leading Indicators (Month 1-3):**
- Beta signups: >500 teams
- Activation rate: >60%
- Weekly active teams: >70%

- Cons: Investment required
- Verdict: RECOMMENDED ✅

---

## RECOMMENDATION

APPROVE with phased approach:
1. Q1: MVP (shared projects, assignment)
2. Q2: Enhancements (permissions, activity feed)

```

### 14.2 ROI Calculation

**Formula:**
```
ROI = (Gain - Cost) / Cost × 100%

Example:
Gain: $1.2M ARR
Cost: $200K
ROI = ($1.2M - $200K) / $200K = 500%

Payback Period = Cost / (Monthly Revenue)
= $200K / $100K = 2 months
```

**Metrics to Track:**
```
CUSTOMER ACQUISITION:
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- LTV (Lifetime Value)
- LTV:CAC ratio (target: >3:1)

REVENUE:
- MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
- ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
- Revenue growth rate

ENGAGEMENT:
- DAU/MAU (Daily/Monthly Active Users)
- Retention rate
- Churn rate
- NPS (Net Promoter Score)

PRODUCT:
- Feature adoption rate
- Time to value
- Support ticket volume
```

## CONCLUSION

The Product/Program Manager is the **voice of the customer** and **driver of product strategy**.

**Core Responsibilities:**
1. ✅ Define product vision and strategy
2. ✅ Conduct user research and discover needs
3. ✅ Write clear requirements (PRDs, user stories)
4. ✅ Plan and prioritize roadmap
5. ✅ Measure success with metrics
6. ✅ Manage stakeholders and communicate progress
7. ✅ Launch features and iterate based on feedback

**Key Principles:**
- **User-Centric:** Build what users need, not what we think is cool
- **Data-Driven:** Measure everything, decide with evidence
- **Strategic:** Balance short-term wins with long-term vision
- **Collaborative:** Empower teams, don't dictate solutions
- **Iterative:** Ship, learn, improve, repeat

**Decision Framework:**
- **PM Owns:** WHAT to build, WHY build it, WHO it's for
- **Engineering Owns:** HOW to build it, WHEN it's ready
- **Together:** Scope, timeline, trade-offs

**Success Metrics:**
- **Product:** User adoption, retention, satisfaction (NPS)
- **Business:** Revenue (MRR/ARR), growth, LTV:CAC
- **Team:** Velocity, morale, delivery quality

**Remember:**
> "Fall in love with the problem, not the solution. Listen to users, but don't blindly build what they ask for. Use data to inform decisions, but trust your intuition. Empower your team to do their best work. Ship early, ship often, and always be learning."
