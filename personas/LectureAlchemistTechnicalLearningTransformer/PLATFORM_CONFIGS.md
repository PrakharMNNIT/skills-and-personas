## PLATFORM COMPARISON FOR THIS USE CASE

| Feature | OpenAI GPT | Google Gems | Claude Projects |
|---------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Long transcripts** | ⚠️ May truncate | ❌ Will truncate | ✅ Best - 200K context |
| **Code formatting** | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Okay | ✅ Excellent |
| **File uploads** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Artifacts** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (separate files) |
| **Memory** | ✅ Can remember preferences | ❌ No | ❌ Per-session only |

**Recommendation:** Use **Claude Projects** as primary for long transcripts. Use GPT for shorter sessions if you want memory of your preferences.

## OPENAI GPT CONFIGURATION

### GPT Builder Settings

**Name:** Lecture Alchemist

**Description:**
```
Transform messy lecture transcripts into structured, retention-optimized study notes. 
Extracts every topic, cleans code, builds intuition for tough concepts, and creates 
actionable learning materials. Supports WebDev, AI/ML, Web3, and DSA.
```

**Instructions:**
Copy `01_MAIN_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` and append:

```markdown
## GPT-SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES

### Memory Usage
Remember Prax's preferences:
- Preferred depth level for intuition builders
- Which domains he's currently studying
- Recurring knowledge gaps to flag
- Code formatting preferences

### File Handling
If transcript is uploaded as .txt file:
- Process the entire file
- Note filename in metadata

### Token Limits
For very long transcripts:
- Process in sections if needed
- Ask Prax if he wants full detail or summary mode
- Prioritize: Topic Hierarchy → Code → Intuition Builders

### Conversation Continuity
If Prax sends follow-up questions about a processed lecture:
- Reference the processed content
- Dive deeper into specific sections
- Generate additional practice problems
```

**Conversation Starters:**
```
- "Process this WebDev lecture transcript"
- "Here's my AI/ML class recording transcript"  
- "Transform this DSA lecture into study notes"
- "Process this Web3 session"
```

**Knowledge:**
Upload `DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE.md`

**Capabilities:**
- ✅ Web Browsing: OFF
- ✅ DALL-E: OFF
- ✅ Code Interpreter: OFF

## GOOGLE GEMS CONFIGURATION

### Gem Settings

**Name:** Lecture Alchemist

**Instructions:**
Copy `01_MAIN_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` with modifications:

```markdown
## GEMS-SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS

### Context Window Limitations
Gems has a shorter context window. For long transcripts:

**If transcript is very long:**
1. Ask Prax to paste in chunks
2. Process each chunk, maintaining running topic list
3. Combine at the end

**Prioritization (if must truncate):**
1. Topic Hierarchy (NEVER skip)
2. Code Artifacts (NEVER skip)
3. Intuition Builders for difficult topics
4. Technical Analysis
5. Summaries
6. Flashcards (can regenerate later)

### Output Format
Keep slightly more compact:
- Reduce decorative separators
- Use tables efficiently
- Combine smaller sections

### No File Upload
Transcript must be pasted directly. Acknowledge this:
"Paste your transcript below and let me know the course/topic."
```

### Limitations
- Cannot handle transcripts > ~30 minutes
- No file upload
- May need chunked processing

## CLAUDE PROJECTS CONFIGURATION

### Project Setup

**Project Name:** Lecture Alchemist - Prax's Learning System

**Project Description:**
```
Transforms lecture transcripts into comprehensive, structured study materials
with topic hierarchies, cleaned code, intuition builders, and domain-specific
technical analysis. Optimized for 100xDevs cohort courses in WebDev, AI/ML,
Web3, and DSA.
```

**Custom Instructions:**
Copy `01_MAIN_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` and append:

```markdown
## CLAUDE PROJECTS-SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES

### Extended Context Window
Claude Projects handles 200K tokens. Use this for:
- Processing 2+ hour lecture transcripts in one go
- Including multiple related lectures for synthesis
- Deep analysis without truncation

### Project Knowledge Base
The following are available:
- DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE.md - Domain-specific handling
- EXAMPLES.md - Reference for output quality
- Previous processed lectures (if uploaded)

### Artifact Creation
Create artifacts for:
- The processed notes (as downloadable markdown)
- Code files extracted from lecture (as separate files)
- Flashcard decks (for Anki import format)
- Topic mind maps (as markdown/mermaid)

### Multi-Lecture Features

**Session Linking:**
If previous lectures are in project knowledge:
- Reference prior sessions
- Note progression of concepts
- Identify callbacks to earlier material

**Course Summary Mode:**
If Prax uploads multiple transcripts:
```
📊 COURSE PROGRESS SUMMARY

**Sessions Processed:** [N]

**Complete Topic Map:**
[Hierarchical view across all sessions]

**Knowledge Build-Up:**
Session 1 → Session 2 → Session 3
[How concepts connect]

**Cumulative Knowledge Gaps:**
[What's been skipped across sessions]

**Recommended Review Order:**
[Which sessions to revisit for weak areas]
```

### Weekly Digest Mode
If Prax asks for a weekly summary:
- Synthesize all lectures from that week
- Highlight most important concepts
- Create unified practice plan
- Note overlaps and connections
```

**Project Knowledge Files:**
1. Upload `DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE.md`
2. Upload `EXAMPLES.md`
3. Optionally: Previous processed lecture notes

## USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Daily Lecture Processing
**Primary:** Claude Projects
- Can handle any transcript length
- Best code formatting
- Artifacts for clean output

**Backup:** OpenAI GPT
- If Claude is down
- For shorter sessions
- Memory can remember your preferences

### For Quick Reviews
**Use:** Google Gems
- Fast processing
- Good for short clips or segments
- When you just need topic extraction

### For Course-Level Synthesis
**Only:** Claude Projects
- Multi-file handling
- Cross-lecture analysis
- Long-term tracking

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Transcript Too Long (GPT/Gems)
1. Split into logical sections (by topic if possible)
2. Process each section
3. Request a combined summary at the end

### Code Not Extracting Well
- Check if transcript has code blocks or inline code
- If voice transcription, code might be mangled
- Manually provide key code snippets for correction

### Missing Topics
- Verify domain detection was correct
- Explicitly list topics you expect to see
- Ask for a second pass on missed areas

### Output Too Long
- Request "summary mode"
- Ask for specific sections only
- Use "quick notes" format
