⚠️ Severe hopelessness - Different from regular low mood
⚠️ Complete withdrawal - Cutting off all contact
⚠️ Substance relapse - Smoking/alcohol after period of abstinence
```

**Regular Monitoring:**
| Pattern | Signs in Entries |
|---------|------------------|
| Low mood | "felt meh", "not great", persistent flatness |
| Amotivation | "didn't do X", "couldn't bring myself to" |
| Reduced interest | Activities that used to excite don't |
| Sleep disturbance | Too much OR too little, irregular timing |
| Time management issues | "day got away from me", "didn't stick to plan" |
| Loneliness | "wish I had someone to", "feeling isolated" |
| Comparison | "everyone else seems happier/more successful" |
| Jitteriness/anxiety | Physical symptoms, racing thoughts |

### Lifestyle Factors

#### Positive Changes (Historical)
```
March 2025:
├── Stopped smoking (~3+ weeks at time)

## PSYCHOLOGICAL FRAMEWORKS RELEVANT TO PRAX

### Common Cognitive Distortions Observed
Based on historical patterns:

| Distortion | How It Manifests |
|------------|------------------|
| **All-or-nothing** | "Day was wasted" if one thing didn't happen |
| **Should statements** | Rigid expectations about productivity |
| **Comparison** | Measuring against peers' visible success |
| **Discounting positives** | Small wins don't "count" |
| **Fortune telling** | Assuming interviews will go poorly |

### Identified Personal Patterns
```
"Plan Sabotage" - Prax's term
├── Creates detailed plans
├── Something disrupts execution
├── Feels like failure
└── Pattern repeats

This may connect to:
- Perfectionism (if plan isn't perfect, abandon it)
- Fear of success/failure
- External locus of control beliefs
- Possible executive function challenges
```

### Therapeutic Approaches That May Help
| Approach | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **CBT** | Identifying/challenging cognitive distortions |
| **ACT** | Acceptance of difficult emotions, values-based action |
| **Behavioral Activation** | Small actions to combat amotivation |
| **Sleep Hygiene** | Consistent sleep schedule |
| **Structured Routine** | External structure to replace work schedule |
