# CHRONICLE - Psychological Frameworks Reference

## Purpose
This document provides Chronicle with psychological frameworks and concepts to draw upon during analysis. It's a reference for accurate, clinically-informed insights - not a diagnostic manual.

## COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS (CBT Framework)

### Core Distortions

| Distortion | Definition | Example in Journal |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **All-or-Nothing Thinking** | Seeing things in black/white categories | "I didn't finish all my tasks, so the day was wasted" |
| **Overgeneralization** | Seeing single event as never-ending pattern | "I failed this interview, I'll never get hired" |
| **Mental Filter** | Dwelling on negatives, ignoring positives | Entry lists 5 things but focuses on 1 failure |
| **Disqualifying the Positive** | Rejecting positive experiences | "She was just being nice, it doesn't count" |
| **Jumping to Conclusions** | Making negative interpretations without evidence | |
| ↳ Mind Reading | Assuming you know what others think | "Ria must think I'm a failure" |
| ↳ Fortune Telling | Predicting things will turn out badly | "Google interview will definitely go wrong" |
| **Magnification/Minimization** | Exaggerating negatives, shrinking positives | "That small mistake ruined everything" |
| **Emotional Reasoning** | Assuming feelings reflect reality | "I feel like a failure, so I must be one" |
| **Should Statements** | Rigid rules about how things "should" be | "I should have done more today" |
| **Labeling** | Attaching fixed labels to self/others | "I'm such a procrastinator" |
| **Personalization** | Taking blame for things outside your control | "The team failed because I didn't work hard enough" |
| **Comparison** | Measuring self against others | "Everyone else is doing better than me" |

### How to Note in Analysis

**Light level:** Simply name the distortion
> "Some all-or-nothing thinking present in how the day was evaluated"

**Medium level:** Name, quote, and explain
> "The statement 'day was wasted because I didn't do LeetCode' shows all-or-nothing thinking - the walk and good conversation with Ria are being discounted"

**Deep level:** Pattern analysis
> "This is the third entry this week showing all-or-nothing evaluation of daily productivity. This cognitive pattern may be maintaining the depression cycle by converting partial successes into perceived failures."

## DEFENSE MECHANISMS

### Common Defense Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Definition | How It Appears |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Intellectualization** | Using abstract thinking to distance from emotions | Over-analyzing a conflict instead of feeling the hurt |
| **Rationalization** | Creating logical explanations for emotional decisions | "I didn't call because she's probably busy anyway" |
| **Avoidance** | Staying away from anxiety-provoking situations | Not opening LeetCode because of fear of failure |
| **Projection** | Attributing own feelings to others | "Everyone thinks I'm a failure" |
| **Denial** | Refusing to acknowledge painful realities | "Everything is fine" after clear distress signals |
| **Displacement** | Redirecting emotions to safer targets | Frustration at self expressed as irritation with partner |
| **Regression** | Reverting to earlier behaviors under stress | Binge-watching like a college student during exam stress |
| **Suppression** | Consciously pushing away thoughts | "I don't want to think about the interview" |
| **Humor** | Using jokes to deflect from pain | Making light of serious struggles |

### Important Notes
- Defense mechanisms aren't inherently bad - they're protective
- Note when they appear, but don't pathologize
- Chronic reliance on maladaptive defenses is more concerning than occasional use

## EMOTIONAL REGULATION

### Adaptive Strategies (Healthy)

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Problem-solving** | Taking action to address the source | "I was stressed about the deadline, so I made a schedule" |
| **Cognitive reappraisal** | Changing how you think about situation | "Maybe the rejection was a redirection" |
| **Acceptance** | Acknowledging reality without judgment | "Today was hard. It was hard." |
| **Seeking support** | Reaching out to others | "Called Ria to talk through it" |
| **Self-compassion** | Treating self with kindness | "I'm struggling, and that's okay" |
| **Behavioral activation** | Doing activities despite mood | "Went for a walk even though I didn't feel like it" |
| **Distraction** | Temporary attention shift | Using YouTube briefly to reset (not escape) |

### Maladaptive Strategies (Monitor)

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Rumination** | Repetitive focus on distress | "Kept thinking about what I should have said" |
| **Suppression** | Pushing away emotions entirely | "I'm fine. It's fine. Everything is fine." |
| **Avoidance** | Escaping situations that trigger emotions | Not opening emails because of anxiety |
| **Substance use** | Using alcohol/drugs/nicotine to manage | Smoking when stressed |
| **Emotional eating** | Using food to manage emotions | Bingeing or restricting when upset |
| **Self-harm** | Physical harm to manage emotional pain | Any mention - flag immediately |

## DEPRESSION PATTERNS

### Core Symptoms to Monitor

**Emotional:**
- Persistent low mood
- Anhedonia (loss of interest/pleasure)
- Hopelessness
- Worthlessness
- Excessive guilt

**Cognitive:**
- Difficulty concentrating
- Indecisiveness
- Negative self-talk
- Suicidal ideation (passive or active)

**Physical:**
- Sleep changes (insomnia or hypersomnia)
- Appetite changes
- Fatigue/low energy
- Psychomotor changes (slowing or agitation)

**Behavioral:**
- Social withdrawal
- Neglecting responsibilities
- Self-care decline
- Reduced activity level

### Severity Indicators

**Mild:** Some symptoms present, functioning impaired but maintained
**Moderate:** Multiple symptoms, noticeable functional impairment
**Severe:** Most symptoms present, significant functional impairment, possible suicidal ideation

### Red Flags (Require Immediate Attention)
- Suicidal ideation (passive or active)
- Self-harm mentions
- Complete withdrawal from all support
- Inability to perform basic self-care for multiple days
- Expressions of hopelessness about the future

---

## ANXIETY PATTERNS

### Manifestations to Note

**Cognitive:**
- Excessive worry
- Catastrophizing
- Difficulty controlling worry
- Anticipatory anxiety
- Racing thoughts

**Physical:**
- Restlessness
- Fatigue
- Difficulty concentrating
- Muscle tension
- Sleep disturbance
- Jitteriness (Prax has noted this specifically)

**Behavioral:**
- Avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations
- Safety behaviors
- Reassurance-seeking
- Procrastination (anxiety-driven)

### Anxiety-Depression Interaction
These often co-occur. In Prax's case:
- Anxiety may drive avoidance of interview prep
- Avoidance leads to falling behind
- Falling behind confirms negative beliefs
- Negative beliefs deepen depression
- Depression reduces motivation to address anxiety
- Cycle continues

## EXECUTIVE FUNCTION

### Relevant Challenges

| Domain | How It Appears |
|--------|----------------|
| **Initiation** | Can plan but can't start |
| **Sustained attention** | Starts but can't maintain focus |
| **Impulse control** | Intended to work, ended up on YouTube |
| **Working memory** | Forgets steps of multi-part plans |
| **Cognitive flexibility** | Stuck when plans change |
| **Planning** | Difficulty breaking large goals into steps |
| **Organization** | Chaos in physical/digital space |
| **Time management** | Poor estimation, time blindness |

### Depression's Impact on Executive Function
Depression commonly impairs:
- Initiation (amotivation)
- Sustained attention (cognitive fog)
- Decision-making (indecisiveness)
- Processing speed (everything takes longer)

This means "Plan Sabotage" may be neurological, not character failure.

---

## BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION PRINCIPLES

### Core Concept
Action precedes motivation in depression. Waiting to "feel like" doing something perpetuates inactivity.

### Application in Micro-Actions
Instead of: "Work on Google prep when you feel ready"
Suggest: "Open LeetCode for 5 minutes. Just open it."

### Hierarchy of Activation
1. **Basic needs:** Eating, sleeping, hygiene
2. **Routine activities:** Making bed, brief walks
3. **Pleasurable activities:** Things that used to bring joy
4. **Achievement activities:** Work, productive tasks

Always suggest actions at or just above current functioning level.

## SELF-COMPASSION FRAMEWORK (Kristin Neff)

### Three Components

1. **Self-Kindness** (vs. self-judgment)
   - Treating self with warmth when struggling
   - Counter to harsh inner critic

2. **Common Humanity** (vs. isolation)
   - Recognizing suffering is shared human experience
   - Counter to "I'm the only one who struggles like this"

3. **Mindfulness** (vs. over-identification)
   - Balanced awareness of emotions
   - Neither suppressing nor drowning in feelings

### Application
When entry shows harsh self-talk:
- Note the self-judgment present
- Model self-compassionate reframe
- Suggest speaking to self as one would to a friend

## ACT (ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY) CONCEPTS

### Core Processes

| Process | Opposite | Application |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Acceptance** | Avoidance | Can you make room for this feeling instead of fighting it? |
| **Defusion** | Fusion | Notice "I'm having the thought that I'm a failure" vs "I'm a failure" |
| **Present moment** | Past/Future dwelling | What's actually happening right now? |
| **Self-as-context** | Conceptualized self | You are not your thoughts or labels |
| **Values clarification** | Lack of direction | What matters to you beneath the anxiety? |
| **Committed action** | Inaction/impulsive action | Small steps aligned with values |

### Useful Prompts
- "What would you do if the anxiety was there but didn't control you?"
- "If fear wasn't a factor, what would you move toward?"
- "What does this struggle say about what matters to you?"

## SCHEMA PATTERNS (Schema Therapy Lite)

### Potentially Relevant Schemas for Prax

| Schema | Core Belief | How It Might Appear |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Failure** | "I am inadequate/will fail" | Difficulty starting tasks, perfectionism |
| **Unrelenting Standards** | "I must achieve to be worthwhile" | Harsh self-judgment, burnout |
| **Defectiveness** | "I am flawed at my core" | Shame, hiding struggles |
| **Abandonment** | "People will leave me" | Anxiety in relationship conflicts |

### Note
These are deep patterns formed early in life. Chronicle should note when they might be activating but shouldn't attempt to restructure them - that's therapy work.

## CRISIS ASSESSMENT

### When to Flag

**Passive Suicidal Ideation:**
- "Everyone would be better off without me"
- "I don't want to exist"
- "What's the point"
- No active plan, but death seems appealing

**Active Suicidal Ideation:**
- Specific thoughts of methods
- Planning or preparation
- Giving away possessions
- Saying goodbye

**Self-Harm:**
- Any mention of self-injury
- Urges to hurt self

### Chronicle's Response
1. Complete the entry (don't abandon the person)
2. Acknowledge what was shared directly
3. Express care without panic
4. Strongly encourage professional contact
5. Provide crisis resources if appropriate
6. Never promise to keep secrets about safety

## IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS

### What Chronicle Should NOT Do

1. **Diagnose:** "You have depression" vs "Patterns consistent with depression"
2. **Prescribe:** Never suggest medication changes
3. **Replace therapy:** "This would be valuable to explore with Dr. Pallavi"
4. **Catastrophize:** Over-pathologizing normal bad days
5. **Minimize:** Under-reacting to genuine distress
6. **Project certainty:** "This IS" vs "This might be"

### Language Guidelines

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "You have anxiety" | "Anxiety patterns are present" |
| "This is clearly depression" | "This resembles a depressive pattern" |
| "You need to..." | "It might help to..." |
| "Don't worry" | "The worry makes sense given..." |
| "Everything will be fine" | "This is hard, and you're not alone in it" |
