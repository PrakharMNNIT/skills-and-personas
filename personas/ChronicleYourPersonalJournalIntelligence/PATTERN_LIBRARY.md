## IDENTIFIED PATTERNS

---

### Pattern #1: Plan Sabotage

**First Identified:** January 2026 (named by Prax)

**Description:**
Making detailed, often elaborate plans, then having them fall apart before or during execution. Not a matter of bad planning - the plans are often good. Something happens at the execution phase.

**Typical Presentation:**
```
Day 1: Create detailed plan (LeetCode schedule, study routine, etc.)
Day 2-3: Start strong or not start at all
Day 4+: Plan abandoned, guilt/frustration follows
Pattern repeats with new plan
```

**Possible Contributing Factors:**
| Factor | Evidence | Likelihood |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Perfectionism | All-or-nothing abandonment | High |
| Executive dysfunction | Depression-related initiation issues | High |
| Fear of failure | Avoiding proving inadequacy | Medium |
| Overwhelm | Plans may be too ambitious | Medium |
| Depression | Amotivation, energy fluctuation | High |

**What Helps (When Observed):**
- Smaller, single-task plans instead of elaborate systems
- Pre-selection of tasks (reduce decision fatigue)
- External accountability
- Permission to do imperfect execution

**What Doesn't Help:**
- More elaborate planning
- Harsh self-criticism after abandonment
- Immediately making a new plan without reflection

**Frequency:** [Track over time - e.g., "Appears in ~60% of entries mentioning plans"]

**Trend:** [Track - e.g., "Stable", "Improving", "Worsening"]

### Pattern #2: Late Waking Cycle

**First Identified:** January 2026

**Description:**
Waking significantly later than intended (often 11 AM+), leading to a sense of "lost day" and compressed productive time. Often coincides with weird or disrupted sleep patterns.

**Typical Presentation:**
```
Night before: Vague plan to wake at reasonable hour
Actual waking: 10-11 AM or later
Immediate mood: Groggy, already "behind"
Day quality: Often flat, recovery feels difficult
```

**Possible Contributing Factors:**
| Factor | Evidence | Likelihood |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Depression | Hypersomnia is common symptom | High |
| No external structure | No work schedule to anchor | High |
| Sleep quality issues | Self-reported "weird" sleep | Medium |
| Avoidance | Sleep as escape | Medium |
| Medication effects | Some psych meds affect sleep | Possible |

**What Helps (When Observed):**
- Any morning commitment/call
- Gradual wake time adjustment (not dramatic)
- Evening walks (improves sleep quality)
- Not catastrophizing when it happens

**What Doesn't Help:**
- Setting 7 AM alarms (too ambitious, leads to failure)
- Beating self up about it
- Staying in bed after waking

**Frequency:** [Track - e.g., "~3-4 days per week"]

**Trend:** [Track over time]

### Pattern #3: Comparison Spiral

**First Identified:** January 2026

**Description:**
Measuring self against peers' perceived success, leading to feelings of being "behind" and inadequacy. Often triggered by LinkedIn, social media, or hearing about others' achievements.

**Typical Presentation:**
```
Trigger: Seeing someone's achievement or thinking about peers
Thought: "Everyone else is moving, I'm stuck"
Feeling: Inadequacy, hopelessness, shame
Behavior: Withdrawal or frantic (unsustainable) effort
```

**Cognitive Distortions Involved:**
- Comparison (core)
- Mind reading ("they must think I'm a failure")
- Discounting positives (own achievements don't count)
- Fortune telling ("I'll never catch up")

**What Helps (When Observed):**
- Limiting social media/LinkedIn
- Focusing on own trajectory, not others
- Listing concrete personal progress
- Remembering: you're seeing highlights, not struggles

**Frequency:** [Track]

**Trend:** [Track]

### Pattern #4: Evening Redemption

**First Identified:** January 2026

**Description:**
Days that start poorly often improve in the evening, typically with physical movement (walk) or connection (Ria). This is a **positive pattern** to leverage.

**Typical Presentation:**
```
Morning/Afternoon: Flat, unproductive, "meh"
Evening trigger: Walk, call with Ria, physical activity
Shift: Mood lifts, some clarity returns
Night: Reflective, often when journaling happens
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Shows capacity for mood regulation through behavior
- Evening walks are reliable intervention
- Relationship connection is protective factor
- Day isn't defined by how it starts

**How to Leverage:**
- Plan walks intentionally, not just when day is bad
- Don't write off days before evening
- Use evening clarity for next-day micro-planning

**Frequency:** [Track]

## PATTERN INTERACTIONS

Some patterns reinforce each other:

```
Late Waking → Feels "behind" → Comparison Spiral → Plan Sabotage attempt → Failure → Depression deepens → Late Waking

                         ↑ Evening Redemption can interrupt ↑
```

**Breaking the Cycle:**
- Evening intervention (walk) is most reliable interrupt point
- Don't try to fix everything at once
- Small wins > ambitious recoveries

---

## PROTECTIVE FACTORS

Things that consistently help across patterns:

| Factor | How It Helps |
|--------|--------------|
| **Ria** | Stable connection, honest feedback, repair capacity |
| **Evening walks** | Physical movement shifts mood, creates clarity |
| **Self-awareness** | Recognizes patterns, seeks help appropriately |
| **Journaling (this)** | Externalizes thoughts, enables pattern recognition |
| **Previous therapy experience** | Knows it helps, has established relationship with Dr. Pallavi |

---

## RISK FACTORS

Things that consistently worsen patterns:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Social isolation** | Removes protective connection |
| **No external structure** | No anchors for routine |
| **Psychiatric care gap** | Currently not seeing Dr. Pallavi |
| **Physical inactivity** | Stopped Cult, affects mood and health |
| **Sleep dysregulation** | Disrupts everything downstream |
