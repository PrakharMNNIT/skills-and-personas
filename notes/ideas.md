# Agent and App Ideas

Purpose
- Capture promising agent/app ideas to build next, grounded in what people are already making and what fits your goals (DSA, system design, GSoC 2026, return-to-work).

## Signals from public prompt hubs and libraries (what people build)
These themes show up across community prompt libraries and hubs. Use them as demand signals and category inspiration.

- Prompt libraries exist at scale and are community-driven (share, discover, collect prompts). Common pattern: large, browsable catalogs of prompts. Source: prompts.chat and Awesome ChatGPT Prompts. citeturn7search5turn2view0
- Prompt hubs let users browse public prompts, search by use case/model, and fork prompts for reuse in applications. Source: LangSmith docs. citeturn7search4
- Hubs are expanding beyond prompts to chains/agents (community artifact sharing). Source: LangChain Hub announcement. citeturn7search6
- Prompt repositories often organize content by categories such as SEO, business, writing, coding, education, and marketing. Source: sankyn1/awesome-chatgpt-prompts. citeturn3view0
- FlowGPT provides creation guides for prompts/templates and demonstrates creator-driven prompt publishing. Source: FlowGPT docs. citeturn5view3
- Research exists on real-world developer prompts, indicating a strong developer-focused prompt ecosystem. Source: PromptSet paper. citeturn4view3

Takeaway: High-use categories are productivity, coding, education, and marketing. For you, the highest leverage is coding + education + career.

## Your leverage and goals (personal fit)
- 3 years SDE experience -> strong technical framing and practical judgment.
- Restarting DSA + system design -> biggest near-term payoff for interviews.
- GSoC 2026 -> requires proposal writing, open-source onboarding, and mentor communication.
- Motivation dip -> agents that reduce friction and turn goals into tiny steps will help.

## Mental Health Support Agent (non-therapist)
Problem: You want a supportive, structured companion to help with anxiety, MDD, motivation dips, and recovery routines without pretending to be a licensed therapist.
Boundaries:
- Not a substitute for professional care.
- No diagnosis, no crisis intervention.
- Encourage professional help when needed.
Core features:
- Daily check-in (mood, energy, sleep, stress).
- CBT/ACT-style reframing prompts and behavioral activation plans.
- Gentle accountability with micro-steps.
- Weekly review and next-week adjustment.
