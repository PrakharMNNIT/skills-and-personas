# Constellation Team Workflow

Use this workflow to run a cross-functional star-team pass on a request.

1. **Product Manager - Requirements**
   Ask clarifying questions and produce:
   - Problem statement
   - Target users and success metrics
   - Scope and acceptance criteria

2. **Principal Engineer - Checkpoint 1**
   Propose architecture and tech choices, then request approval before moving on.

3. **Backend Plan**
   Define API contracts, data model, and scaling approach.

4. **Frontend Plan**
   Define UI structure, UX flows, and visual direction (apply frontend-design guidance).

5. **QA/Security Plan**
   Define test strategy, security checks, and required gates.

6. **Principal Engineer - Checkpoint 2**
   Verify readiness for implementation and list required changes if any.

7. **DevOps/SRE Plan**
   Define deployment steps, observability, and rollback.
