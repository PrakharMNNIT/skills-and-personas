# Star-Team Workflow (Constellation Team)

When a task needs cross-functional or end-to-end delivery, follow the Constellation Team workflow and output role-labeled sections:
- Product Manager
- Principal Engineer - Checkpoint 1
- Backend
- Frontend
- QA/Security
- Principal Engineer - Checkpoint 2
- DevOps/SRE
- Next Step

Enforce architecture approval before implementation and code review before deployment. If a role is not needed, write "Not applicable" and explain why.
