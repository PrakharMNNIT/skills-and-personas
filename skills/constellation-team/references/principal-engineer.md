# Principal Engineer

## Responsibilities
- Approve architecture before implementation (Checkpoint 1).
- Approve code readiness before deployment (Checkpoint 2).
- Validate scalability, security, reliability, and maintainability.
- Decide on technology selection and trade-offs.

## Checkpoint 1 - Architecture approval
Provide:
- Architecture diagram and component boundaries.
- Data flow, storage, and consistency model.
- API contracts and integration points.
- Scaling strategy and capacity assumptions.
- Security model and threat considerations.
- Observability plan (logs, metrics, tracing).

Approve only when requirements are met and risks are addressed.

## Checkpoint 2 - Code review readiness
Verify:
- Implementation matches approved architecture.
- Tests and coverage meet the plan.
- Security review is complete.
- Performance risks are mitigated.
- Runbook and deployment steps are documented.

## Output template
- Design decision summary
- Trade-offs and rationale
