## 💼 Professional Background

### Amazon SDE (July 2022 – September 2025)
**Teams:** Payments & Travel

#### Key Projects Built:
1. **Webhook Service** — Real-time flight schedule changes (cancellations, date-changes)
   - Idempotency checks, audit logging, automated offline modifications
   - Addressed 10-15% of bookings affected by airline changes
   
2. **Hotel Booking Platform** — Full-stack with search, listing, details, room-selection, order-review
   - Prime-exclusive discount flow
   - Partner discount service integration
   
3. **Auto-Insurance Purchase Flow** — Multi-stage with progress persistence (Milestoning)
   - One-Click Renewal using past-purchase data
   - 60% more users completed renewals

4. **Async Workflow Orchestration** — AWS Step Functions for hotel booking workflows
   - Confirmation, cancellation, retries
   - Fault-tolerant, reliable processing

#### Performance Wins:
- Reduced hotel landing-page p90 latency by **47%** (1.1s → 0.59s)
- GZIP compression cutting payload by **95%** (150-200 MB → manageable)
- Reduced on-call tickets from **20+ to ~5** per shift

#### Tech Stack Used:
- **Languages:** Java, JavaScript, C++
- **Frontend:** React.js (SSR & CSR), Redux
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Spring Boot, GraphQL, REST
- **AWS:** Lambda, DynamoDB, Step Functions, AppSync, CloudWatch, ECS, CDK, API Gateway

## 🎯 Learning Configuration

### Timeline
- **Duration:** 6-9 months (no artificial deadline)
- **Availability:** Full-time focus
- **Approach:** Top-Down (Gabriel Petersson methodology)

### Resources Available
- ✅ Educative.io subscription
- ✅ CodeCrafters.io subscription
- ✅ Full-time availability
- ✅ AI as Socratic tutor (Claude/ChatGPT)

### Learning Philosophy (Committed To)
1. **Start with projects/problems** — not courses
2. **Learn concepts when needed** — just-in-time, not just-in-case
3. **Recursive gap-filling** — drill into unknowns until "click"
4. **No vibe coding** — understand foundations of every shortcut
5. **Teach it back** — verify understanding by explaining

## 🚀 Current Focus

### Active Project: CodeCrafters "Build Your Own Shell" (Java)
- **Status:** Starting fresh
- **Goal:** Learn Java advanced concepts + algorithms through building

### Weakness Priority (Frightening Scale — Most to Least)
1. 🔴 Design Principles (don't know where to apply)
2. 🔴 Machine Coding Round
3. 🟠 System Design
4. 🟠 DSA (advanced: Heap, DP, Graph, Greedy, Segment Tree, Union-Find)

## 💡 Key Insight for ATLAS

Prax has **production intuition** from building real systems at Amazon scale. The knowledge exists implicitly — it needs to be:
1. Made explicit through building
2. Formalized with proper terminology
3. Connected to patterns and principles
4. Deepened in areas never formally studied

**The goal isn't to teach Prax from scratch — it's to surface, connect, and deepen existing implicit knowledge while filling genuine gaps.**
