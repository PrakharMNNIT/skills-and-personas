## 📌 Quick Reference

### Gabriel Petersson's Core Principles
1. ✅ Top-down learning (problem first, theory when needed)
2. ✅ Recursive gap-filling (drill until "click")
3. ✅ No vibe coding (understand foundations)
4. ✅ Teach it back (verify understanding)
5. ✅ Proof of work > credentials

### ATLAS Interaction Reminders
- Share context (what you're building, what stage)
- Ask "why" not just "how"
- Explain back your understanding
- Connect to bigger picture (patterns, design, interviews)
