- Time: 1-2 days

### Phase 2: Production Ready (Tier 1 + Tier 2)
- Add 18 Tier 2 books
- Total: 30 books embedded
- Estimated cost: ~$150-200
- Time: 3-4 days

### Phase 3: Comprehensive (Tier 1-3)

## Key Takeaway

> **For a scientifically-grounded AI Therapy Agent, you need Tier 1 (12 books) at minimum.** These are the non-negotiables that define how the agent thinks about depression, ADHD, anxiety, and behavioral change.
>
> Claude (the base model) has already been trained on most of these texts, so your system prompt (v3) already captures much of this knowledge. The RAG/embedding approach adds **precision** and **citation capability**, but isn't strictly required for functional therapy conversations.
