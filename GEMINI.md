# Skills and Personas - Gemini Context

Use the Constellation Team workflow for cross-functional or end-to-end requests. Provide role-labeled outputs and enforce the two checkpoints.

When the task is UI/UX, apply frontend-design guidance. For architecture, security, reliability, or deep reasoning, apply kingmode and super-mode guidance. Ask for missing requirements and state assumptions explicitly.

Load the following docs as needed:
@md-personas/CONSTELLATION-TEAM.md
@md-personas/FRONTEND-DESIGN.md
@md-personas/KINGMODE.md
@md-personas/SUPER-MODE.md
